## Maven-Analytics-kickstarter-projects-Dataset-Analysis

This repository consists (Maven Analytics Kickstarter Projects ProjectReport) **pdf** in which I have explained every step during this analysis, a (KickstarterProject_SQL) **SQL script** which I have created to analyze data in SQL and a (KickstartProject) **jupyter notebook** script I have created during this analysis.

**Project Overview: -**
This data analytics project focuses on analyzing a Kickstarter dataset obtained from Maven Analytics. The dataset encompasses various projects from different domains and countries, detailing their current status, goals, backers, and more. Following the structured data analytics process, the project covers the Ask, Prepare, Process, and Analyze stages.

**Ask: -**
The project aims to uncover insights about variables affecting project success and strategies for maximizing success. Key research questions include identifying success factors and exploring the impact of location and project goals. Hypotheses are formulated around the significance of location and project goals in determining success.

**Prepare: -**
The dataset, provided by Maven Analytics, is considered reliable and secure. Two CSV files, containing data and metadata, are explored to understand the dataset's structure. Steps involve checking data types, ranges, and formats, while data cleaning focuses on removing duplicates, handling incomplete or inconsistent data, and verifying accuracy in textual and numerical columns.

**Process: -**
Data preparation involves utilizing Excel, SQL, and Python for analysis and computation, with Tableau employed for data visualization. Steps include checking data types, ranges, and formats, eliminating duplicates and outliers, and ensuring data accuracy. Documentation outlines the cleaning and manipulation process, covering steps like checking column data types, handling blanks, removing duplicates, and validating numerical values.

**Analyze: -**
Analysis is initiated in Google BigQuery for querying and understanding the data. Python is then employed for further analysis and visualization. Tableau proves instrumental in exploring the data, performing in-depth analysis, and creating interactive dashboards for comprehensive insights.

**Next Steps: -**
Continuing the analysis in Python, the project aims to delve deeper into the dataset, extracting meaningful insights and trends. The focus is on refining visualizations, identifying patterns, and drawing actionable conclusions. The GitHub repository contains the complete project report, data files, and documentation, ensuring transparency and collaboration.
